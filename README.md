## Installation

After cloning the repository to your local computer, you will then need the necessary dependencies. This can be accomplished by running ```npm install```. Thanks to Concurrently, this will perform the different installation requirements for the application to run. 

## Usage

After you have installed the dependencies and such, you want to make sure that you run your build using ```npm run build```. This will build the webpack. Once you have done this step, you can run the application in localhost by typing ```npm run start``` in the command line. You can also right click the index.html file in your dist folder and open in live server if you want to play with the application code in real time. 

## Contributions

The repository is public, and can be accessed, and adjusted, by anyone with a Github account.

## Tests

Once you have done the final step in the Usage section, you can access the application in your default browser. You can type anything into the text editor, which will then be saved to your IndexedDB called 'jate'. Your text should also persist when you reload the webpage. Lastly, the install button should provide a prompt that will allow the user to download the 'Text Editor' application to your computer including a shortcut on your desktop.
